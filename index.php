      <p>Hopefully, you're reading this because you love our photography and are keen to know a little more about us, 
      the team that creates those images - and it really is very much a team effort:  while Paul's photographic craftsmanship 
      is at the heart of the what we do, this luxury brand of ours is built around superlative service as much as the creativity 
      of one of the UK's most sought-after photographers.</p>
  
      <p>Although it's Paul who is the Master Photographer, there is a dedicated team here making sure you have the very very best 
      experience possible: from the first phone call or email to the moment you pick up your beautiful frames and custom-made albums 
      from us, there is someone who can help make sure everything is absolutely perfect for you - which is precisely why Belmond Le 
      Manoir aux Quat'Saisons and The Crazy Bear Hotels recommend us to their clients!</p>
  
      <p> Here you'll find us taking care of our discerning clients who, in turn, love gorgeous portrait photography, 
      beautiful wedding photography and everything that goes with it. And tea. We do love our tea. And cookies. Never 
      forget the cookies.</p>
  
      <p> Paul and his team are passionate about creating beautiful wedding and portrait photography. But more than that - 
      far more than that - it's about creating stories: stories of joy and laughter; of love, family and affection; of loved 
      ones, siblings and parents, cousins and friendships. And all with a little artistry, ah yes, the artistry. </p>
